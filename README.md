# smartos-memory
A simple shell script to list memory used by VMs on SmartOS in an interactive remote shell session.
Meant to help prevent manual overcommits with which I've carelessly brought down one of my compute nodes once.
Since then, all my interactive shells greet me with the output of this script.
